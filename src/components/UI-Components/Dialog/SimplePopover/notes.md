# SimplePopover
This component is an implementation of Material-UI's [Simple Popover demo](https://material-ui.com/components/popover/#simple-popover). 
The content of the popover as well as the target component used to open the popover is configurable. The component currently
makes an assumption that all popovers will have a Close button at the bottom and implements this by default. This will 
probably change in the future but can be refactored easily to handle customization of the DialogActions.
