# LocationMultiSelectFieldGroupButton
This component wraps the generic `LocationMultiSelectFieldGroup` with a `SelectWithNoMenu` and `Popover` component. This
component handles managing it's own reference to the values selected so that upon closing out of the Popover the values
can be reset. This component also handles the logic for hiding/showing the Popover and the text displayed in the button.
