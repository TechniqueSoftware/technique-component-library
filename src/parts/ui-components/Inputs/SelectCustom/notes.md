# SelectCustom
This component wraps our `Select` component and customizes it to allow us to display any component in a popover. This
allows us to use this component for custom purposes like we do inside of the `MultiSelectFieldGroupButton` component

### Usage
This was ultimately created to be used inside of the `MultiSelectFieldGroupButton` component.
