# TimeInput
This component wraps Material-UI's [TextField](https://material-ui.com/api/form-control/) and passes type='time' to
create a textField component used strictly for time values. Accepts and passes values in the 'hh:mm' format, 
military style. 11:04 AM becomes '11:04', 01:03 PM becomes '13:03'.
