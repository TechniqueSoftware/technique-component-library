# DateRangeFieldset
This component wraps our StartAndEndInput component and two of Material UI's [Input](https://material-ui.com/api/input/) 
components and adds custom stylings. The component comes with built in functionality for handling the date logic between
the date range select and the StartAndEndInput.
